# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
Using Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type and with MatPlotLib create multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 

## Purpose
Analyze the given datasets, ride_data("location", "date" and "fare" for each ride) and city_data ("city","drivers","city type") and find out how the data differs by "city type" and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Resources
  - Jupyter Notebook
  - Python 3.7.6
  - Dependencies
      - Python Pandas library
      - Python Numpy library
      - Python MatPlotLib library

## Requiements

1. Create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. 
2. Using Pandas and Matplotlib, create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.
3. Report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
